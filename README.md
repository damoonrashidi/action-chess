# Action Chess!

Action chess is the same chess you know and love, with castling, en passant, promotions and all that, but _real time instead of turn based_. Each piece has a cooldown that limits how often it is allowed to move.

## Things that are done

- [x] Render a board
- [x] Move pieces about
- [x] render board in terminal

## What isn't yet implemented but being worked on

- [ ] Find a list of legal moves
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Render to some ui

## Roadmap

- _Deck building_ - Draw cards while you are playing to assemble a deck with special powers such as "Rewind a square", "duplicate", "transform".
